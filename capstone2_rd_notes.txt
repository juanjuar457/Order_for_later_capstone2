fixing the order form styles.. 

then add the get logic to the front end to render 
the materials on the DB when 
ajax call and render loop etc.. 
state transfer etc.. 


styling>> 
top header **
title of cells to dark 
input cells are to big with text! 
align the added materials to align with the input cells. 
make the top input cells align to one size, Drop down is off. 
text and alignment in the added materials must match the input cells!!

pencil bs was messing with the text styles, for some reason?? 
built in styles were autofilling with some random bs 
relative position etc... 

drop down has an id of units! use the #units to style it mang! 


target #units and #ofl_body

looks like styling on the options tag is ! working! 
looks like its ignored! might just have to style the other input cells 
around the options at the end. 

to style the input cells you have to make the input class and 
do input-class[placeholder] {//blah}
to do the height of the box, looks like 15px or so works just fine

also need to re style the set back order to a color! 
and explain those directions somewhere!
nodestone mlab and clean folders to open on default 
mlab hook up 

5/5>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-ofl main page style still fucked
-can't target the options drop down that gets created??? Seems to ignore any styles we put on it! 
-line up the input cells and match the palceholder and active text, using the options drop down as the size frame for all of them...
-figure logic for adding the init get on page open.. 
-hook up mlab and deploy to heroku! 
-also noticed that the vs files in my folder were there now?? do they do anything to the web render / github?? 
	-noticed b/c when i used the upload to git hub w/ the vs files the arrow pics were kind of weird looking 

-style **
-logic for get xx
-mlab upload 
-clean out css**
-not sure where the add button is getting its styles from?? 
back order button and delete === broken on init get!! 
"" and 			"" still ok on newely created materials. 
resizing is fucked
styling is ok, bootstrap auto % on all props, had to match
fix del arrow later..
will we need the placeholder text vs the top heading desc..??? 

page init > get ajax > put in state > render state > 
standby to add new entries
API === materials[].materials[] have to point to root of the array to get it out and render it! 

** looks like array render won't work, need to add them 1 by 1
make anothwer render function that won't flush the dom?? probably why its undefined! 
->> org notes,
.. fix the back order and delete buttons on materials already in the db 
fix add button?? 
styles on the options tag?? 
fix landing page desc
prosper..


React stuff

102-111 
for get init 
ajax call 
diff is you have to loop through materials and add them to state 
1 at a time

or take array out of data and set === array in state 
then call render material list and 
all should be rendered

kg and format to look more like table, padding, margins etcc.. fix me
heading colors, and font size could come down just headers 
fix unit sizes so you can just put in numbers.. 
center out OFL header, or header row so its diff from other page 
on top. 
make back to landing as little button up top

need to figure how stuff is getting rendered and render whats in the 
db out to the client..

Add button OMG fix that height! 

if the order on the schema is diff the order isn't consitent through the 
client through the server! 

array is returning back the data in a diff order.. 
catalog_number
:
"te"
id
:
"590b509378978421183a632a"
onBackOrder
:
false
product_name
:
"tes"
quantity
:
"test"
unit_size
:
"tes"
units
:
"gm"
vendor
:
"test"

order may not actually matter.... 

'product' vs 'product_name' in client vs server..

fix the placeholder text size, might be too big....


mongod --dbpath data/db
part 2 also have to make the setbackorder and delete work on the old stuff....

the back to landing is broken


5/5 - get init works!!! 
del button is broken
set backorder is broken too. 
because of where the info on the db sleeps we got to go to state.requested_materials[0].materials.length and probably make 
a seprate set of set backorder and delete ajax calls pointing to that insted of the default which was just state.requested_materials. 
-set backorder color styles 

change color scheme, light bckgrnd + dark text 
nuke the db, and add 10 rows on submit 
with actual stuff 
footer on the bottom, lil copyright stuff 
back to landing at bottom and top! >> change to home
dark backtournd header row on OFL header or left justified and have home button on right
